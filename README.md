# Manual Rover Control System (MRCS)
A repository for developing the User Interface for receiving data and controlling the rover
## Packages Info

# Autolaunch

This guide will show you how to set up and launch the MRCS (Manual Rover Control System) using ROS 2 on a Docker bash terminal.

## Required Packages
1. ROS2 Docker Terminal
2. Latest version of Tmux: A link to a very useful guide: https://www.hamvocke.com/blog/a-quick-and-easy-guide-to-tmux/

## Instructions

1. Open your ROS 2 Docker terminal.
2. Create a new directory named `ros2_ws` with a subdirectory called `src` using `mkdir -p ros2_ws/src`.
3. Navigate to `src` by running `cd ros2_ws/src`.
4. Clone the latest version of the MRCS repo using `git clone git@github.com:GonzagaRobotics/ManualRoverControlSystem.git`.
5. Navigate out of `src` in the top of the directory `ros2_ws` by running the command `cd ros2_ws`.
6. Build the project by running `colcon build`.
   - If you encounter the error message `stderr: teleop_twist_joy`, run `colcon build` again to resolve it.
7. Source ROS2 in the parent directory by running the command: `. install/setup.bash`.
8. Startup `tmux`.
   -a green status bar should appear. If it doesn't, make sure you have tmux installed in your docker container and try again.
9. Open a tmux split screen terminal
   - A link to tmux keybinds here: https://www.hamvocke.com/blog/a-quick-and-easy-guide-to-tmux/
   - To close out of a panel at any time, type `exit` or hit `CTRL+D`.
10. Navigate to a terminal run the command `ros2 launch src/ManualRoverControlSystem/autolaunch/launch/auto_launch.py`. 
    - You can stop this launch process at any time by pressing `CTRL+C`. The output should look something like this:
    
      ```[INFO] [launch]: All log files can be found below /root/.ros/log/2023-02-25-03-11-34-708275-2f922f3c3a13-1665
      [INFO] [launch]: Default logging verbosity is set to INFO
      [INFO] [joy_node-1]: process started with pid [1666]
      [INFO] [XboxBroker-2]: process started with pid [1668]
      [INFO] [CommandExposer-3]: process started with pid [1670]
      ```
      
11. Navigate to another terminal panel.
12. In the bottom panel, run `ros2 topic list`.
    - The list should look something like this:
       ```/cmd_vel
       /joy
       /joy/set_feedback
       /motor_command
       /motor_command_exposed
       /parameter_events
       /rosout
       ```
       
13. Congratulations, you’re all set!


### command_broker:
* Source from ros_ws: `. install/setup.bash`
* Command: `ros2 run command_broker XboxBroker`
* A node named XboxBroker that subscribes to 'joy' and publishes to 'motor_command' topic
* The topic 'motor_command' only includes the relevant data from the Xbox controller. The contents are likely to change.
* 'motor_command' contains multiple float messages that is mapped as follows:
    - left trigger. Resting is 0.99999 and fully compressed is -0.99999
    - right trigger: Resting is 0.99999 and fully compressed is -0.99999
    - left shoulder: Resting is 0, compressed is 1
    - right shoulder: Resting is 0, compressed is 1
    - d pad left and right. resting is 0, left is 1 and right is -1


### teleop_twist_node:
* From inside the ros_ws directory, run `. install/setup.bash`
* Command: `ros2 launch teleop_twist_joy teleop-launch.py joy_config:=’xbox’ joy_dev:=’dev/inputs/js1’`

    - Note the the name of the USB might change so js1 might be different

* Cloned from this repo: [Link](https://github.com/ros2/teleop_twist_joy/tree/humble)
* Responsible for receiving the Xbox controller commands and publishing them to the 'joy' topic




## Microcontroller Connection Instructions
These instructions assume the micro_ros_agent is already created on the host machine. To do this, follow the instructions on this link under Creating the micro-ROS agent https://micro.ros.org/docs/tutorials/core/first_application_linux/

Steps to connect microcontroller to ROS2:

* Plug microcontroller into Jetson over USB
* Determine the USB connection name: `ls -l /dev/tty*`
* (Optional) You might need to change the permissions on the USB to allow it to communicate: `sudo chmod 666 /dev/'connection name'`
* Go into microros_ws directory
* `source install/setup.bash`
* `ros2 run micro_ros_agent micro_ros_agent serial --dev /dev/'connection name'`
* Press the enable button on the microcontroller
* You should now be able to see the microcontroller's nodes and topics using ros2 topic list and ros2 node list.

## USB connection to Docker container
 * Linux automatically does this
 * Windows and Mac possible methods for USB connection
  * USB over IP: https://github.com/jiegec/usbip

## Goals
* The rover and its various sub-systems will be controllable via a Manual Rover Control System (MRCS). 
* The MRCS will allow a human operator to drive the rover and manage its various sub-systems, including the operation of the manipulator arm. 

* The MRCS will have a User Interface (UI), that displays critical environmental information to the operator, including video stream and sensor data. 

## Methodology
* We will design, implement, test, and document an intuitive UI to display environmental data to a human operator and allow them to control the rover. 

* The MRCS will utilize ROS2 to send commands to and receive data from the rover over a wireless connection. 
* We will test the various components and overall whole of the MRCS using a [Simulation](https://github.com/orgs/GonzagaRobotics/projects/11) of our rover. 

## Deliverables
* A Manual Control System (MRCS) that allows a human operator to drive the rover and operate its various components. 
    - The MRCS will display important data transmitted from the rover including video stream and other data. 

## Timeline
### October 2022: 
* Preliminary MRCS R&D complete: Architecture designed and framework(s) chosen for building, development started
### December 2022:
* MRCS v1.0.0 released: Major release of MRCS, rover sim can be fully controlled over ROS2 actions in a UI. Data from the rover (or rover sim) is displayed, including but not limited to video stream and sensor data. Physical rover will likely not be in a state for real world testing. Will need to test sending actions over the comms platform to the jetson once Electrical/Embedded has the comms platform ready to test.
### February 2023:
* MRCS (minor release v1.x.x) capable of controlling physical rover, if complete. If not complete, MRCS capable of communicating over Comms system to send and receive all data and commands that would be necessary for control. MRCS capable of initiating ARCS control sequence.
