This guide will show you how to set up and launch the MRCS (Manual Rover Control System) using Docker on a bash terminal
## Required Packages
1. On a Linux OS or VM
2. Docker Installation (Do not install the snap store version of docker)
3. Latest version of Tmux: A link to a very useful guide: https://www.hamvocke.com/blog/a-quick-and-easy-guide-to-tmux/

## Instructions Common
1. Open your bash terminal
2. Clone the latest version of the MRCS repo using `git clone git@github.com:GonzagaRobotics/ManualRoverControlSystem.git`

Steps 3 to 5 only if wanting to connect the joystick

3. type `ls -l /dev/input/j`
4. type `Tab` twice to find which number with `js#` is the XBox controller
    - Then press `Enter`
5. If the joystick is not `js0` some other `js#` then change the following:
    - run `cd ManualRoverControlSystem/autolaunch/launch`
    - in `auto_launch.py` change all instances of `js0` to `js#`
    - go back and run `cd ManualRoverControlSystem/docker_scripts/for_host`
    - in `docker-compose.yml` change all instances of `js0` to `js#`

## Instructions if only using one PC

Steps 1 to 2 only if wanting to connect a microcontroller
1. Plug in microconroller to computer with USB
2. Run `sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyUSB0`
   - May have to change `ttyUSB#`
3. Go back and run `cd ManualRoverControlSystem/docker_scripts`
4. Run the command `tmux` (could also open a new terminal screen if you do not want to use `tmux`)
5. Open a tmux split screen terminal with `CTRL+B` and pressing `"`
   - To close out of a panel at any time, type `exit` or hit `CTRL+D`.
6. On the terminal navigate to `for_host` by running `cd for_host`
7. Run `docker compose up` to start the Xbox controller
8. Press `CTRL+B` and then the `up arrow` to navigate to the other termnial
9. In that terminal navigate to `for_jetson` by running `cd for_jetson`
10. Run `docker compose up -d`

For debugging

11. Open a tmux split screen terminal from here with `CTRL+B` and pressing `"`

Step 12 only if wanting to connect a microcontroller

12. In this terminal run `docker start -ai for_jetson-micro-ros-agent-1`
    - There should be messages from the microcontrollers here
13. Press `CTRL+B` and then the `up arrow` to navigate to the other `for_jetson` termnial
14. In this terminal run `docker exec -it for_jetson-ros_echo-1 bash`
15. In this docker container run `ros2 topic list` to see if `motor_command` is listed
16. Then run `ros2 topic echo /motor_command/left_trigger` to see if this container can see the left trigger

## Instructions if using the host PC and Jetson
1. setup antennas for the host PC and Jetson from the `antenna_setup.md` file in the repo
2. Go back and run `cd ManualRoverControlSystem/docker_scripts/for_host`
3. Run `docker compose up` to start the Xbox controller
4. On another terminal instance run `ssh robotics@192.168.0.2`
   - enter the password to enter into the Jetson
5. Plug in microconroller to Jetson with USB
6. In the Jetson if not automatically done run `sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyUSB0`
   - May have to change `ttyUSB#`
7. In the Jetson run `cd ~/ManualRoverControlSystem/docker_scripts/for_jetson`
8. Run `docker compose up -d`

For debugging

9. On the Jetson run the command `tmux`
10. Open a tmux split screen terminal from here with `CTRL+B` and pressing `"`
11. In this terminal run `docker start -ai for_jetson-micro-ros-agent-1`
    - There should be messages from the microcontrollers here
13. Press `CTRL+B` and then the `up arrow` to navigate to the other `for_jetson` termnial
14. In this terminal run `docker exec -it for_jetson-ros_echo-1 bash`
15. In this docker container run `ros2 topic list` to see if `motor_command` is listed
16. Then run `ros2 topic echo /motor_command/left_trigger` to see if this container can see the left trigger

## Instructions the common result of from both
1. Press the `right trigger` on the XBox controller and the motors should spin

## Instructions common for debugging both

# Autolaunch

This guide will show you how to set up and launch the MRCS (Manual Rover Control System) using ROS 2 on a Docker bash terminal.

## Required Packages

1. ROS2 Docker Terminal
2. Latest version of Tmux: A link to a very useful guide can be found [here](https://www.hamvocke.com/blog/a-quick-and-easy-guide-to-tmux/).

## Instructions

1. Open your ROS 2 Docker terminal.
2. Create a new directory named `ros2_ws` with a subdirectory called `src` using `mkdir -p ros2_ws/src`.
3. Navigate to `src` by running `cd ros2_ws/src`.
4. Clone the latest version of the MRCS repo using `git clone git@github.com:GonzagaRobotics/ManualRoverControlSystem.git`.
5. Navigate out of `src`.
6. Build the project by running `colcon build`.
   - If you encounter the error message `stderr: teleop_twist_joy`, run `colcon build` again to resolve it.
7. Source ROS2 in the parent directory by running the command: `. install/setup.bash`.
8. Startup `tmux`.
   - A green status bar should appear. If it doesn't, make sure you have tmux installed in your docker container and try again.
9. Open a tmux split screen terminal
   - A link to tmux keybinds can be found above.
   - To close out of a panel at any time, type `exit` or hit `CTRL+D`.
   
10. Navigate to a terminal and run the command to launch all nodes at once: `ros2 launch src/ManualRoverControlSystem/autolaunch/launch/auto_launch.py`
   
   - By default, all nodes are launched with main launch command.
   - To stop specific nodes from launching, you can add any of the following commands after the main launch command: 
      - Add `xbox_broker:=False` to stop the Command Broker node from launching.
      - Add `command_exposer:=False` to stop the Command Exposer node from launching.
      - Add `command_receiver:=False` to stop the Jetson_Comm node from launching.
      - Add `teleop_twist_node:=False` to stop the Teleop_Twist node from launching.
      - Add `realsense2_camera:=False` to stop the RealSense Camera node from launching.
   - For example, if you wanted to stop both the Command Exposer and Jetson_Comm nodes from launching, you'd use the command: `ros2 launch src/ManualRoverControlSystem/autolaunch/launch/auto_launch.py command_exposer:=False command_receiver:=False`
   - If you're inside the Jetson container the command to accomplish the same task would look like this: `ros2 launch autolaunch/launch/auto_launch.py command_exposer:=False command_receiver:=False`
   
      - At any time with the following command, you can stop the launch file by pressing `CTRL+C`. If you choose to launch all nodes at once, the output should look something like this(in this example the realsense camera wasn't connected):
    
      ```[[INFO] [launch]: All log files can be found below /root/.ros/log/2023-04-01-19-41-14-650243-docker-desktop-1043
        [INFO] [launch]: Default logging verbosity is set to INFO

        [realsense2_camera_node-2] [WARN] [1680378074.923078773] [camera.camera]: No RealSense devices were found!
        [CommandReceiver-5] [INFO] [1680378074.966731093] [CommandReceiver]: I have initialized up successfully.
        ```
      
11. Navigate to another terminal panel.
12. In the bottom panel, run `ros2 topic list`.
    - The list should look something like this:
    ```/cmd_vel
    /joy
    /joy/set_feedback
    /motor_command
    /motor_command_exposed
    /parameter_events
    /rosout
    ```
       
13. Congratulations, you’re all set!


### command_broker:
* Source from ros_ws: `. install/setup.bash`
* Command: `ros2 run command_broker XboxBroker`
* A node named XboxBroker that subscribes to 'joy' and publishes to 'motor_command' topic
* The topic 'motor_command' only includes the relevant data from the Xbox controller. The contents are likely to change.
* 'motor_command' contains multiple float messages that is mapped as follows:
    - left trigger. Resting is 0.99999 and fully compressed is -0.99999
    - right trigger: Resting is 0.99999 and fully compressed is -0.99999
    - left shoulder: Resting is 0, compressed is 1
    - right shoulder: Resting is 0, compressed is 1
    - d pad left and right. resting is 0, left is 1 and right is -1


### teleop_twist_node:
* From inside the ros_ws directory, run `. install/setup.bash`
* Command: `ros2 launch teleop_twist_joy teleop-launch.py joy_config:=’xbox’ joy_dev:=’dev/inputs/js1’`

    - Note the the name of the USB might change so js1 might be different

* Cloned from this repo: [Link](https://github.com/ros2/teleop_twist_joy/tree/humble)
* Responsible for receiving the Xbox controller commands and publishing them to the 'joy' topic




## Microcontroller Connection Instructions
These instructions assume the micro_ros_agent is already created on the host machine. To do this, follow the instructions on this link under Creating the micro-ROS agent https://micro.ros.org/docs/tutorials/core/first_application_linux/

Steps to connect microcontroller to ROS2:

* Plug microcontroller into Jetson over USB
* Determine the USB connection name: `ls -l /dev/tty*`
* (Optional) You might need to change the permissions on the USB to allow it to communicate: `sudo chmod 666 /dev/'connection name'`
* Go into microros_ws directory
* `source install/setup.bash`
* `ros2 run micro_ros_agent micro_ros_agent serial --dev /dev/'connection name'`
* Press the enable button on the microcontroller
* You should now be able to see the microcontroller's nodes and topics using ros2 topic list and ros2 node list.

## USB connection to Docker container
 * Linux automatically does this
 * Windows and Mac possible methods for USB connection
  * USB over IP: https://github.com/jiegec/usbip

## Goals
* The rover and its various sub-systems will be controllable via a Manual Rover Control System (MRCS). 
* The MRCS will allow a human operator to drive the rover and manage its various sub-systems, including the operation of the manipulator arm. 

* The MRCS will have a User Interface (UI), that displays critical environmental information to the operator, including video stream and sensor data. 

## Methodology
* We will design, implement, test, and document an intuitive UI to display environmental data to a human operator and allow them to control the rover. 

* The MRCS will utilize ROS2 to send commands to and receive data from the rover over a wireless connection. 
* We will test the various components and overall whole of the MRCS using a [Simulation](https://github.com/orgs/GonzagaRobotics/projects/11) of our rover. 

## Deliverables
* A Manual Control System (MRCS) that allows a human operator to drive the rover and operate its various components. 
    - The MRCS will display important data transmitted from the rover including video stream and other data.
